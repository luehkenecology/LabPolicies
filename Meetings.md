**1-1 meeting (weekly)**
1-1 meetings are used to discuss the current progress and setting priorities.

1. Meeting lasts approximately 30 to 60 minutes.
2. Meeting starts with a review of the agreed priorities of the past week and ends with setting new priorities (maximum of 3) for the coming week. 
3. Todos for the PI with deadlines.
4. The lab member takes notes, which are sent to PI within the next 24 hours. Notes can be very brief (in german or english) and you should not spent more than 15 minutes on this and should be structured as:
    + Lab member name, date
    + Priorities
    + Todos for PI
    + Open points (open questions, non-prioritized issues ...)
